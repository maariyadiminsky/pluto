# Pluto

A light-weight app that displays a numerology report based on your birthday.

For the initial creation I focused on a more simple approach with minimal library use, practicing good folder structure and reusable components.

Included is a [`numerology mock API`](https://github.com/maariyadiminsky/numerology-mock-api) I created since there was nothing available for free matching the api I was searching for.

----
### Future improvements:
- Calendar and date libraries
- Using react-hooks, router etc.
- Typescript
- Numerology reports for 11,22,33 etc.
- Focusing on responsiveness
- Spend more time perfecting the api
- Use graphQL to make create an efficient single request with only the data needed when generating report.
- More null/undefined checks
- Loaders
- add eslint etc.
